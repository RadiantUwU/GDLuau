# GDLuau

About
-----
GDLuau is for in-game scripting / UGC / modding.
*(This is **not** a replacement for or an alternative to GDScript.)*

Luau API closely follows Lua 5.1 API, you can find the manual [here](https://www.lua.org/manual/5.1/manual.html).<br />
For coding in lua/luau take a look at the ["Getting Started" section](https://luau-lang.org/getting-started) on [luau-lang.org](https://luau-lang.org).<br />
